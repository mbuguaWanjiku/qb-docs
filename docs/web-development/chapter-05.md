Note: To start writing better Ruby and Rails code please take a look at the "style guide" pointers. They really are helpful in avoiding common mistakes and writing code others can understand easily. Also, a great way to have this always present is to install [Atom's linter plugins](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-rubocop), that give you realtime tips and warnings based on these style guides.
