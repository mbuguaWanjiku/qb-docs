# Part IV - Javascript in detail

## Introduction

Javascript is special and needs it's special Part in this series. In the first chapter you learned the fundamentals of Javascript but now it's time to go beyond and be really proactive.

To begin with, read [this](http://www.sitepoint.com/top-javascript-frameworks-libraries-tools-use/) article about the top Javascript Frameworks.

Most certainly it will not be required that you learn all frameworks listed here, one will. Some of them have a steep learning curve so experiment with several but choose one in some point or you will ramble around and will not be efficient with none of them.

## 1. You, meet patterns, patterns meet you

These are not the basics, no no no. The basics are available in the first part of this development path...but there are a number of patterns that will help any developer write better JS code, and understand better the true potential of this scripting language. Knowing them all from the beginning is nearly impossible, but it is the the main goal of every (good) JS developer out there so embrace the journey and learn a new pattern everytime you feel confy with JS, it will show you that you didn't know that much about it.

## 2. JQuery and DOM

You already checked out what the DOM is in the basics part of this series but take a further look in what you can o with it in pure javascript or JQuery. JQuery is one of those things that if you continue to use, you will visit [their site](https://jquery.com/) quite a lot to search the documentation.

## 3. AngularJs

Angular is going through a reconstruction phase, so It's not clear that what you learn on current version 1.x will be still useful in 2.x but it is still the most used javascript framework out there.

## 4. React

React can be confusing and overwhelming, the learning curve is a little steep, so take a time to be introduced to the framework with these articles

If you're building a website that deals with dynamic data, it is highly recommended you follow the Flux architectural design, which promotes a single directional dataflow. When React is used with Flux, it brings you the functionality of an MVC. However, according to Facebook, current MVCs don't scale well with building additional features to a large codebase, so React + Flux was their solution.

Now, a proper tutorial
