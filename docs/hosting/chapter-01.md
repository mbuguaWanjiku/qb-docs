# Part I - Virtual Machines

## Introduction

Imagine being able to use a Windows XP, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 or a Mac and Linux on the same computer. That's the main concept behind this, but your computer is still YOUR computer as originally you want it, so all these machines will be installed on an "app", getting the point? Sure you do, it's a concise explanation (applause), but here I leave a more precise one:

A picture is worth a thousand words _ain't it_? Anyhow, nothing like getting your hands dirty.

## 1. Virtualbox

[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is one of the most popular and free Virtual Machine software around, made by some guys called [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation), you may have heard of them, and is a decent way to get started playing around multiple **O**perating **S**ystems and installing and experimenting stuff without making a mess of your computer.

- Install Virtualbox from their site, and Guest additions as well........ (what?! no videos?, __NO!__ at this time you are your own man...or women).
- Begin with a nice ubuntu beautiful alternative, [elementaryOs](https://elementary.io/). This is not an innocent random choice, it's a light OS that is a perfect replacement for Windows when it comes to developing a Ruby On Rails applications.
