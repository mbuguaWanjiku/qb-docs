# Part I - Agile intro: The manifesto

## Introduction

Hello developer!

Already know your developer tools? Do you know how to make an app and write code? How about methodology?

Take your time to read and interiorize these lines. Many companies work with these principles in mind, specially startups and flexible companies. I'm focusing here on Agile methodology that I think is the most important concept when thinking about [Software development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process). Also, bear in mind that this is not a closed concept, the development cycle of any agile approach is constantly being revised and improved. Companies and teams take what their need is from this approach and add their cut.

The next chapters will focus in how Agile really may be applied on your daily work.

### The Agile manifesto
<center>

    Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    Working software over comprehensive documentation
    Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    Responding to change over following a plan

    That is, while there is value in the items on
    the right, we value the items on the left more.

### Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

    Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
    through early and continuous delivery
    of valuable software.

    Welcome changing requirements, even late in
    development. Agile processes harness change for
    the customer's competitive advantage.

    Deliver working software frequently, from a
    couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
    preference to the shorter timescale.

    Business people and developers must work
    together daily throughout the project.

    Build projects around motivated individuals.
    Give them the environment and support they need,
    and trust them to get the job done.

    The most efficient and effective method of
    conveying information to and within a development
    team is face-to-face conversation.

    Working software is the primary measure of progress.

    Agile processes promote sustainable development.
    The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
    to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

    Continuous attention to technical excellence
    and good design enhances agility.

    Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
    of work not done--is essential.

    The best architectures, requirements, and designs
    emerge from self-organizing teams.

    At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
    to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
    its behavior accordingly
