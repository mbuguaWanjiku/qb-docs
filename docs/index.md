# Welcome

This project is about <span class="highlight">centralizing</span> and <span class="highlight">learning</span> from good and <span class="highlight">free</span> resources. You may be a newbie or experienced developer or just wanting to become one, this is for you. I use this for my own personal bible and to help interns on their way! I don't know everything here, only what I need to use depending on the project. And that's one of the reasons you should choose a subject, because it would be the right tool for your next project.

Be warned, this is made from a Web developer's point of view. All of these subjects are tendentious and partial.

Subjects include:

- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- Ruby on Rails
- Microsoft's MVC
- Mobile development
- Responsive
- React & Angular
- Docker
- Big Data
- Analytics

For **outsiders**, reading this, if you are a newbie, it would be nice for you to have a [sensei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensei) to take some pointers or ask a question if you get stuck. Don't have one? don't get scared! Register and post your question at [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). Don't think that you'll get answered 2 days or a week later, it can happen but you may have your answer in the next 5 minutes too. __Community__ is key for newbies and experienced developers.

<span class="highlight">NOTE:</span> This documentation is not finished and may very well not ever be finished, it will follow it's path depending on interns needs or demand. The menu on the left reflects a group of intentions on topics of interest, many of them are not (maturely) developed and the topics not ready have a **(*)** flag.
