# Welcome

I hope you will be able to learn what you need in the path to become a successful:

* Web Developer
* Front-End Developer
* Software Developer
* Full-Stack Developer

One of, or if you want, all of above

# Why

Needing of a [job](https://www.google.pt/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=web+development+jobs)?
This course will get you covered on what you'll need to do just that!

# How

I won't be the one teaching you, I'll just compile here a set of resources for the technologies and best practices I care the most in this point in time and suggest you a path you can take.
