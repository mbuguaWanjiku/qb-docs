# Welcome

This project is about centralizing and <span class="highlight">learning</span> from good and <span class="highlight">free</span> resources. You may be a newbie or experienced developer or just wanting to become one, this is for you.

Becoming **awesome** is the goal here. Old or new techs is not the main concern, market demand is.

Subjects include:

- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- Ruby on Rails
- Microsoft's MVC
- Atom
- Responsive
- React & Angular
- Docker
- Big Data
- Analytics

If you are a newbie, it would be nice for you to have a [sensei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensei) to take some pointers or ask a question if you get stuck. Don't have one? don't get scared! Register and post your question at [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). Don't think that you'll get answered 2 days or a week later, it can happen but you may have your answer in the next 5 minutes two. __Community__ is key for newbies and experienced developers.
