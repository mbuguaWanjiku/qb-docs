# Meteor

_Work in Progress_

## Introduction

[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), or MeteorJS, is a free and open-source JavaScript web framework written using Node.js. Meteor allows for rapid prototyping and produces cross-platform (web, Android, iOS) code. It integrates with MongoDB and uses the Distributed Data Protocol and a publishâ€“subscribe pattern to automatically propagate data changes to clients without requiring the developer to write any synchronization code. On the client, Meteor depends on jQuery and can be used with any JavaScript UI widget library.

Well this seemed like it was written by a robot...but it was actually [wikipedia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_(web_framework))
