# Part III - Static website generation

## Introduction

You are now capable of working on any project as a web developer. You will learn in this phase what is used so that non-developers can add and update content to their website, and so that you don't have to work side by side with them daily.

## 1. CMS's

In short, Content Management Systems give any normal user the possibility to edit and manage their site, not having to code, in a supposingly simple manner. There are a lot of CMS's around so feel free to search a couple of them and see how they work before moving along. Take a look at [Concrete5](https://youtu.be/YYUt1MdJ6TM) video to have an idea of what a CMS is typically capable of doing. Some of the most popular CMS's are

- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) made originally for blogs, now on any kind of site, can have ecommerce plugin as well, demo [here](http://www.opensourcecms.com/scripts/details.php?scriptid=88)
- [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) for sites and blogs mainly
- [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) paid, for ecommerce sites only
- [Prestashop](https://www.prestashop.com) free, for ecommerce

There are groups of concepts and functionalities common to them all, like:

- Themes
- Plugins
- Multisite & Multi-language
- Custom fields
- Hooks

## 2. Basic generation - Mkdocs

This is how this documentation is done and maintained. Pretty easy.

- [Mkdocs main site and documentation](http://www.mkdocs.org/)
- Learn [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) so that you can change and make suggestions in form as a `merge request` and improve what you have seen in your path in (frontend) web development.

## 3. Advanced generation - Jekyll

If you want to design your own website and make a generator for everytime you change or add something to your contents Jekyll can help you.

## 4. Project

### PART I

Make a documentation project with mkdocs similiar to this (qb-docs) you are reading. How? Follow the steps on [mkdocs.org](www.mkdocs.org) and you'll be fine.

As the mkdocs exercise is as simple it can be, I got another one for you.

### PART II

Redo your single page website based on the template from Part I with Jekyll.
It is important that you **think about content and how to organize it** easily, and how it will scale depending on the final user or content manager. It is fairly a pretty large project, if you are able to have a coherent solution at the end of this it would leave me so proud of you!
