# Part I - Backend

## Introduction

Backend development is not essential to make a website, but it is to make a web application or deliver data from a database. A good starting point for learning backend development is to learn Ruby and the most famous Gem available for Ruby, Rails. Just a quick tip on managing both: Use [RVM](https://rvm.io), it's a little catchy at first but it will be much simpler to manage ruby version in time. I'm getting ahead of myself with this tip...begin with the biginning:

- [What is Ruby on Rails](http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html)
- [Boring? Sure...here you go](http://skillcrush.com/2015/01/29/13-ruby-rails/)

## 1. Starting off with Ruby

## 3. Rails
Proper tutorial:

- [Tuts + Ruby on Rails 4 for beginners (18 videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4PHKQqKQiLf0WU1Rp-O13RILwCbR38yk)

Other resources to have at the same time you learn rails on the tutorial above:

- [Rails style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide). They really are helpful in avoiding common mistakes and writing code others can understand easily. Also, a great way to have this always present is to install [Atom's linter plugins](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-rubocop), that give you realtime tips and warnings based on these style guides.
- [Rails Bible](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) and the guides to release you from doubts. Everytime you don't remember something or have some doubts about activerecord for instance, this is your _Oracle_.
