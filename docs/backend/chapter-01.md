# Part I - Backend

## Introduction

Backend development is not essential to make a website, but it is to make a web application or deliver data from a database. A good starting point for learning backend development is to learn Ruby and the most famous Gem available for Ruby, Rails. Just a quick tip on managing both: Use [RVM](https://rvm.io), it's a little catchy at first but it will be much simpler to manage ruby version in time. I'm getting ahead of myself with this tip...begin with the beginning:

- [What is Ruby on Rails](http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html)
- [Boring? Sure...here you go](http://skillcrush.com/2015/01/29/13-ruby-rails/)

Learning Ruby on Rails is great now because there are plenty (good) tutorials out there. Here are some suggestions for this path in no particular order or preference.

## 0. Suggestion 1 - Edx

As an alternative or as an additional resource you could take an online course at [edX](https://www.edx.org/). There is an [Agile Development Using Ruby on Rails - The Basics](https://www.edx.org/course/agile-development-using-ruby-rails-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x) and an Advanced series starting in September 2016. As always, absolutely free resources.

## 0. Suggestion 2 - Odin project

The [odin project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) is a nice alternative for having a complete understanding of how to build a web applications in rails from beginning to end. It requires some time to complete each step and correspondent project but the final project is......facebook!! (nice going odin!).

- [Rails odin project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails)


### <span class="highlight">NOTE</span> In case you chose one of the above options, this Part ends here for you! Congrats!

## 1. Suggestion 3 - Keep myself here, and start off with Ruby

The final alternative is just another way of learning, it is a quicker way I guess but bear in mind the cons and pros that this could mean.

- [CodeAcademy Ruby course (9 hours interactive course)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby)
- [Ruby style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)

## 2. MVC

## 3. Rails
Proper tutorial:

- [Tuts + Ruby on Rails 4 for beginners (18 videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4PHKQqKQiLf0WU1Rp-O13RILwCbR38yk)

Other resources to have at the same time you learn rails on the tutorial above:

- [Rails style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide). They really are helpful in avoiding common mistakes and writing code others can understand easily. Also, a great way to have this always present is to install [Atom's linter plugins](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-rubocop), that give you realtime tips and warnings based on these style guides.
- [Rails Bible](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) and the guides to release you from doubts. Everytime you don't remember something or have some doubts about activerecord for instance, this is your _Oracle_.

## 4. Hosting on heroku

Hosting your app online can be a challenge with rails. Many versions of ruby, rails, gems, etc, etc. And free? Seems almost impossible. Thankfully there's heroku that simplifies all this and where you can be up and running in little time.

- Official guides from heroku for [getting started](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4), you don't need nothing more that this (yeih!).
