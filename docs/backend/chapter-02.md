# Part II - Microsoft's ASP.NET MVC

_Work in Progress_

## Introduction

Developing a website or application in .NET is not something new. These guys have been around for quite some time and nowadays have a decent and open (freeish) development framework. I suspect a brutal part of the concepts behind ASP.NET MVC has come from the Rails world so getting to know one will make you learn the other without great effort.

Although development of a Microsoft MVC app is still most natural in [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and in Windows environment, there is already an option for mac and linux, checkout the .NET Core in the [asp.net website](http://www.asp.net/).

## 1. MVC

If you haven't, please watch the video about MVC (only the concept) on the latest Ruby on Rails part.

## 2. C# or VB.net

One of the biggest choices is to choose between these two programming languages. You can learn both and that's ok, but [take a look](http://www.harding.edu/fmccown/vbnet_csharp_comparison.html) at each and begin with one of them to be able to learn what's up ahead. Suggestion? C#.

- [One video for C#](https://youtu.be/lisiwUZJXqQ) from Derek Banas is great to get started and to experiment the language before moving along to ASP.NET MVC, if you have a schedule this is the way. If you consider yourself very newbie consider starting on the next tutorial, more complete and with more steps to make you take some time to interiorize the language.

## ASP.net MVC

- These [tuts](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started) are really complete but can make you put a gun to your head quickly, (much info and all around) So why is it here? because it can be like a Bible when you need to learn something specific along the way. EF? What? Entity Framework? What? ...just come inside and search for it...

- [Advisable tutorial](http://www.asp.net/mvc/videos/pluralsight-building-applications-with-aspnet-mvc-4). Plurasight is a paid service but Microsoft has made it possible to people to learn from these great video tutorials in MVC 4. You may notice MVC is now on version 5 but you can always uddate yourself after with [MVC 5 Fundamentals](http://pluralsight.com/training/Player?author=scott-allen&name=aspdotnet-mvc5-fundamentals-m1-introduction&mode=live&clip=0&course=aspdotnet-mvc5-fundamentals) which are also free.

## Project

As sensei says, "much to learn you still have". So there is much more around this Microsoft's universe that touches MVC and this Project chapter gives you a glimpse of Azure.
