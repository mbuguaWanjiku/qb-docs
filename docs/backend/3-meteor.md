# Meteor

## Introduction

[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), or MeteorJS, is a free and open-source JavaScript web framework written using Node.js. Meteor allows for rapid prototyping and produces cross-platform (web, Android, iOS) code. It integrates with MongoDB and uses the Distributed Data Protocol and a publishâ€“subscribe pattern to automatically propagate data changes to clients without requiring the developer to write any synchronization code. On the client, Meteor depends on jQuery and can be used with any JavaScript UI widget library.

Well this seemed like it was written by a robot...but it was actually [wikipedia!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_(web_framework))

Well but it pretty sums up what this is all about, hence it's appeal. Cross-platform development is a holy grail for a developer. Wow! I can make an app that runs on a browser and mobile phones?! Without having to rewrite my code? Genius!

It plays well with other frameworks like angular but bear in mind that this is neither a pure js framework like we've seen before with angular or js or a backend like Ruby on Rails although I did end up putting this framework on the backend series...hummm.

## Install

- Install following the [official path](https://www.meteor.com/install), nothing's wrong here.

## First app

Guess what? We're going to build a To Do App. **Oh happy days!**

_Yeah, I know they are paid for this false happiness...I hope they are a real family at least._

Moving on!

While your there (in the install page) click on the link below that says _Tutorials_, there you'll have the **To Do App** perfect to understand how all of this works! Didn't catch that? [Here's the link](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/angular/creating-an-app).

## Second app - Wazzuuup

We're sticking with the official documentation here for a while. They have a tutorial to build a Whatsapp application with meteor, angular and ionic. [Check it out](https://angular-meteor.com/tutorials/whatsapp/meteor/bootstrapping) and improve it!

## Problems? Meteor video tuts

Problems with step 1 and 2? No biggy

This guys at LevelUpTuts have done a great job making 2 series of Meteor video tutorials in Youtube.

- Begin with the [Meteor 1.4 Everyone Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHGaNQgSl1lppoNrpjlr24z5)
- Continue to the **Intermediate Meteor** series [here](https://youtu.be/BI8IslJHSag?list=PLLnpHn493BHFYZUSK62aVycgcAouqBt7V)

## Project?

Come on! your a big fellow, no need to do another project now...you've already done a whatsapp application haven't you?!

!!! warning "Answer me dammit!"
